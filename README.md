**[Harmony - pprof module extension](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/pull/3773)**

Pprof is a golang tool for resource profiling, e.g. CPU, memory, goroutine, etc, which is powerful for developer to discover and resolve performance and memory leak issues. Other than profiling over HTTP, the developed extension is able to periodically dump all kinds of pprof data to local disk according to user settings without having any impact on the prior performance of the core protocol of [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/).

**[OptyFi - Integrating Convex Finance and Lido](https://github.com/Opty-Fi/defi-adapters/pull/1)**

[OptyFi](https://opty.fi/) is a protocol powered by AI to help generate wealth in DeFi by investing in the most profitable risk-adjusted yield strategies across hundreds of liquidity pools, dozens of protocols, and multiple blockchains. In this project the protocol has been extended by integrating [Convex Finance](https://www.convexfinance.com/) and [Lido](https://lido.fi/). The overall goal was to maximize the liquidity, utility and profitability of ETH, stETH, CRV and other Curve assets in DeFi.
