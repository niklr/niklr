**[Harmony - pprof module extension](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/pull/3773)**

Pprof is a golang tool for resource profiling, e.g. CPU, memory, goroutine, etc, which is powerful for developer to discover and resolve performance and memory leak issues. Other than profiling over HTTP, the developed extension is able to periodically dump all kinds of pprof data to local disk according to user settings without having any impact on the prior performance of the core protocol of [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/).

**[OptyFi - Integrating Convex Finance and Lido](https://github.com/Opty-Fi/defi-adapters/pull/1)**

[OptyFi](https://opty.fi/) is a protocol powered by AI to help generate wealth in DeFi by investing in the most profitable risk-adjusted yield strategies across hundreds of liquidity pools, dozens of protocols, and multiple blockchains. In this project the protocol has been extended by integrating [Convex Finance](https://www.convexfinance.com/) and [Lido](https://lido.fi/). The overall goal was to maximize the liquidity, utility and profitability of ETH, stETH, CRV and other Curve related assets.

**[2nd Place Nervos Blockchain Hackathon](https://www.nervos.org/blog/nervos-gitcoin-hackathon-winners-announced)**

During the month-long virtual hackathon, development teams worldwide worked to build the next generation of DeFi projects on [Nervos](https://www.nervos.org)'s premier EVM L2 solution, Godwoken. The winners were chosen by a panel of nine judges from across the spectrum of blockchain companies and partners. Each project was scored using a six-part criteria, from ease-of-use to technical complexity.

  **[HOPR - Token Transfers Network Graph](https://twitter.com/hoprnet/status/1400025895428149251)**

  The [HOPR protocol](https://hoprnet.org) provides network-level and metadata privacy for every kind of data exchange. A mixnet protects the identity of both sender and recipient by routing data via multiple intermediate relay hops that mix traffic. The developed project enables users to gain a bird view on the HOPR token transfers on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) and [xDai chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/). It visualizes the life-cycle (provenance) in a network graph: a. Minting b. Transfer c. Burning.

  **[Kickback - Turn registration into NFT](https://github.com/wearekickback/contracts/pull/76)**

  Kickback is one of the oldest Ethereum dApps still in active use. Kickback is an event attendee management platform which reduces no-shows at events and launched in September 2016. In this project the existing Solidity smart contracts have been modified to mint a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) during the registration process. The solution is deployed on multiple chains such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), [xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/) and [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/).

  **[Golem - Full-text Search Engine](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/issues/1457)**

  [Golem Network](https://www.golem.network/) is an accessible, reliable, open access and censorship-resistant protocol, democratizing access to digital resources and connecting users through a flexible, open-source platform. The goal of this project was to build a full-text search service on Golem. The service allows its users to perform search queries over a corpus of documents submitted by the requestor during deployment.
